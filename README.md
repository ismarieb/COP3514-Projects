# FurnitureRent

Program has been created for assignment done in second year.

Guidelines:
A furniture renting store has asked you to create a program that 
calculates the rental costs. The store rents several types of furniture. Furniture is rented 
monthly.  
 
1. A minimum fee (usually higher than monthly cost) is charged for the first month.  
2. After the first month, the store charges a monthly rental fee.  
3. There is a maximum charge for any given year.  
4. The program takes furniture selection and number of months as input. It 
calculates and prints the charge.  
5. Input validation: the program validates the input for furniture selection (1-5) and 
numbers of months (greater than 0). If any of the two inputs is invalid, the 
program print a message and exit.
